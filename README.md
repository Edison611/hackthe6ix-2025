# CommonRoom

_‚ÄúNot every meeting needs to be a meeting.‚Äù_

## üß† Project Overview

**CommonRoom** is a Ribbon-powered platform designed to help teams reduce redundant stand-up meetings by replacing them with asynchronous, structured check-ins. 

Project managers and coordinators can use CommonRoom to send Ribbon-style interviews to employees ‚Äî short, direct, and async. Team members answer questions on their own time, and their responses are analyzed with generative AI to surface key insights. 

Whether a manager wants detailed responses or just a quick summary of the overall team mood, CommonRoom delivers it ‚Äî no calendar invites required.

## üö© Problem

Too many meetings waste time and drain productivity, especially when the purpose could have been met with a simple check-in.

> The modern workplace needs something **between ‚Äúthis could‚Äôve been a message‚Äù and ‚Äúwe need to talk.‚Äù**

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

CommonRoom makes daily syncs async:
- Managers send out structured interview flows to employees.
- Employees answer when it‚Äôs convenient.
- AI-powered summaries surface key themes and feedback.
- Managers can read full responses or just the highlights.

Save time, capture insight, and bring focus back to deep work.

## üîó Ribbon Endpoints Used

This project uses the following Ribbon API endpoints:
- POST request to /interview-flows, for creating "Meetings/Questionnaires"
- POST request to /interviews, several of these are made to create a special interview link for each person in a role
- GET request to /interviews, for retrieving transcripts of the "Meetings/Questionnaires" and display it for others to see

## üß™ How It Works

1. **Create a Question Flow**
   - Define a set of questions for a specific project or role.
   - Assign a flow ID and role-based targeting.

2. **Invite Respondents**
   - Add recipients (employees) and assign them to roles.
   - Automatically distributes interview links to the interview flow.

3. **Respond**
   - Employees respond asynchronously.
   - Transcripts are stored and analyzed.

4. **Summarize**
   - Use Google Gemini API to summarize individual responses.
   - Optionally, generate an overall summary per question to gauge team sentiment.
