# StandDown

_“Not every meeting needs to be a meeting.”_

## 🧠 Project Overview

**StandDown** is a Ribbon-powered platform designed to help teams reduce redundant stand-up meetings by replacing them with asynchronous, structured check-ins. 

Project managers and coordinators can use StandDown to send Ribbon-style interviews to employees — short, direct, and async. Team members answer questions on their own time, and their responses are analyzed with generative AI to surface key insights. 

Whether a manager wants detailed responses or just a quick summary of the overall team mood, StandDown delivers it — no calendar invites required.

## 🚩 Problem

Too many meetings waste time and drain productivity, especially when the purpose could have been met with a simple check-in.

> The modern workplace needs something **between “this could’ve been a message” and “we need to talk.”**

## ✅ Solution

StandDown makes daily syncs async:
- Managers send out structured interview flows to employees.
- Employees answer when it’s convenient.
- AI-powered summaries surface key themes and feedback.
- Managers can read full responses or just the highlights.

Save time, capture insight, and bring focus back to deep work.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Create a Question Flow**
   - Define a set of questions for a specific project or role.
   - Assign a flow ID and role-based targeting.

2. **Invite Respondents**
   - Add recipients (employees) and assign them to roles.
   - Automatically or manually distribute the question flows.

3. **Respond**
   - Employees respond asynchronously.
   - Transcripts are stored and analyzed.

4. **Summarize**
   - Use Google Gemini API to summarize individual responses.
   - Optionally, generate an overall summary per question to gauge team sentiment.
